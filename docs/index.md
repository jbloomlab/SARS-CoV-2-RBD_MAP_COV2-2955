# Interactive structural visualizations of mutational escape from COV2-2955

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on binding by the monoclonal antibody COV2-2955.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
Raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_COV2-2955/blob/master/results/supp_data/COV2-2955_raw_data.csv).


Sites where mutations reduce binding are shown for each monoclonal antibody or polyclonal plasma, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J)).
